                                                                                                Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson &amp; Johnson were quickest off the mark in getting COVID vaccines into American arms, but Novavax is hoping to add another pandemic vaccine to the U.S. mix soon—and it&#39;s pushing new campaigns to get the word out.
                                                                                            </p><p>

                                                                                            </p><p>

And it does have a strong, vocal following online that&#39;s eagerly awaiting a U.S. decision.

But it fell out of favor amid weakening efficacy and major manufacturing issues.

But they might use an older, “tried and tested” tech, as Novavax puts it.

                                                                                            </p><p>

There are questions about how well mRNA vaccines work in younger children. There are also safety concerns, notably the rates of myocarditis in young and adolescent boys, who appear to be more at risk from this condition, which can cause dangerous inflammation of the heart.
                                                                                            </p><p>

That becomes very important, and that’s also the market we are starting to make inroads in,&#34; Taylor said.
                                                                                            </p><p>

                                                                                            </p><p>

This particular campaign is aimed at consumers, Taylor said.
                                                                                            </p><p>

But the site does link to a <a href="https://www.wedovaccines.com/about-novavax">second site</a> that dives much more deeply into the protein technology Novavax uses for the COVID vaccine, approved with the brand name Nuvaxovid in Europe. (The name hasn’t been confirmed in the U.S. yet.)
                                                                                            </p><p>

This campaign&#39;s <a href="https://www.knowourvax.com/#vaccine-program">website</a> talks a little about Novavax itself and its history—and more about its vaccine tech and its pipeline, which includes work on other respiratory diseases. 
                                                                                            </p><p>

                                                                                            </p><p>

Neither want to talk to journalists about their marketing or education plans (at least this one). Marketing wasn&#39;t allowed while they were sold under emergency authorization, but now that they have full FDA approval, they can. Still, Pfizer has over the past four months been releasing a series of new DTC ads similar in tone to what Novavax is doing.

First, the biopharma has been around 34 years now, but until last year, never saw a drug authorized or approved. As it nears a possible green light in its native U.S., that’s a lot of pressure for management to deliver.
                                                                                            </p><p>

It has since said it has cleared up any remaining issues with the FDA in a recent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/novavaxs-covid-19-vaccine-moves-closer-to-fda-authorization-decision-11646562601" target="_blank">interview</a> with The Wall Street Journal.

Taylor said Novavax isn’t thinking too far ahead in terms of marketing after an approval, saying they “are solely focused on delivering these new campaigns and our vaccine around the world.”
