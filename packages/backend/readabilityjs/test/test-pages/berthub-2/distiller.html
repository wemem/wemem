                                In short: the vaccine mRNA has been optimized by the manufacturer by changing bits of RNA from (say) <code>UUU</code> to <code>UUC</code>, and people would like to understand the logic behind these changes. This challenge is quite close to what cryptologists and reverse engineering people encounter regularly. On this page, you’ll find all the details you need to get cracking to reverse engineer just HOW the vaccine has been optimized.

                                I thought this would just be a fun puzzle, but I have just been informed that figuring out the optimization procedure &amp; documenting it is tremendously important for researchers around the world, as this would help them design code for proteins and vaccines.

                                The vaccine contains RNA code for a very <em>slightly</em> modified copy of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein.
                            </p><p>
                                The RNA code of the vaccine itself however is <em>highly</em> modified from the viral original! This has been done by the manufacturer, based on their understanding of nature.
                            </p><p>
                                And from what we understand, these modifications make the vaccine <strong>much much more</strong> effective. It would be a lot of fun to understand these modifications. It might for example explain why the Moderna vaccine needs 100 micrograms and the BioNTech vaccine only 30 micrograms.
                            </p><p>
                                Here is the beginning of the S protein in both the virus and the BNT162b2 vaccine RNA code. Exclamation marks denote differences.
                            </p><pre><code>Virus:   AUG UUU GUU UUU CUU GUU UUA UUG CCA CUA GUC UCU AGU CAG UGU GUU

                                RNA is a string (literally) of RNA characters, <code>A</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>G</code> and <code>U</code>. There is no physical framing on there, but it makes sense to analyse it in groups of three.
                            </p><p>
                                Each group (called a codon) maps to an amino acid (denoted by a capital letter). A string of amino acids is a protein. Here is what that looks like:
                            </p><pre><code>Virus:   AUG UUU GUU UUU CUU GUU UUA UUG CCA CUA GUC UCU AGU CAG UGU GUU
          M   F   V   F   L   V   L   L   P   L   V   S   S   Q   C   V
Vaccine: AUG UUC GUG UUC CUG GUG CUG CUG CCU CUG GUG UCC AGC CAG UGU GUG
               !   !   !   !   ! ! ! !     !   !   !   !   !            
</code></pre><p>
                                Here we can see that while the codons are different, the amino acid version is the same. There are 4*4*4 codons but only 20 amino acids. This means you can typically change every codon into one of two others, and still code for the same amino acid.
                            </p><p>
                                So in the second codon, <code>UUU</code> was changed to <code>UUC</code>. This is a net addition of one ‘C’ to the vaccine. The third codon changed from <code>GUU</code> to <code>GUG</code>, which is a net addition of one <code>G</code>.
                            </p><p>
                                <strong>It is known that a higher fraction of <code>G</code> and <code>C</code> characters improves the efficiency of an mRNA vaccine</strong>.
                            </p><p>
                                Now, if that was all there was to it, this could be the end of this page. “The algorithm is change codons so we get more G and C in there”. But then we meet the 9th codon which changes <code>CCA</code> to <code>CCU</code>.
                            </p><p>
                                Throughout the ~4000 characters of the vaccine, this happens many times.

                                The goal is: find an algorithm that modifies the ‘wild type’ RNA code into the BNT162b2 one. Because everyone would like to understand how to turn viral RNA into an effective vaccine. The algorithm does not need to reproduce the <em>exact</em> RNA code of course, but it would be super nice if it came up with something very similar, while also being brief.
                            </p><p>
                                To help you, I have provided the data in a number of forms, as described on <a href="https://github.com/berthubert/bnt162b2" target="_blank">the GitHub page</a>.

                                The easiest place to start might be the ‘<a href="https://github.com/berthubert/bnt162b2/blob/master/side-by-side.csv" target="_blank">side-by-side.csv</a>‘ file. This lists the original and modified version of each codon, side by side:

                                These implement a simple strategy that works like this:

                                We know that one goal of the ‘codon optimization’ is to get more <code>C</code>s and <code>G</code>s into the vaccine version of the RNA. However, there is also a limit to that. In DNA, which is also used to manufacture the vaccine, <code>G</code> and <code>C</code> bind together strongly, to the point that if you put too many of these ‘nucleotides’ in there, the DNA will no longer be replicated efficiently.
                            </p><p>
                                So some modifications may actually happen to manage <em>down</em> the GC percentage of a stretch of DNA if it was getting too high.

                                Some codons are rare in human DNA, or in certain cells. It may be that some codons are replaced by other ones simply because they are more frequently used by some cells.

                                We’ve been looking at codons up to here. The RNA itself however does not know about codons, there are no markers that say where a codon begins and ends. The first codon on a protein however is always ATG (or AUG in RNA).

                                RNA curls up into a shape. This shape might help evade the immune system or it might improve translation into amino acids. This only depends on the sequence of RNA nucleotides and not on specific codons.
