                                        I’m minding my own business, wandering around the Internet when I am smacked in the eyes by an interesting blog title – “Dwarf begone! Five early medieval ways to rid yourself of dwarfs” (<a href="https://thijsporck.com/2020/05/03/dwarf-begone/">https://thijsporck.com/2020/05/03/dwarf-begone/</a>)<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        I believe it is the worst kept secret that I tend to be easily earwormed, and an even worse kept one that a “song” called Diggy, Diggy hole is particular effective as a weaponised version. (I recommend the Wind Rose version if you need to check it out) I was amused, then, to read:
                                    </p><p>
                                        <br/>
                                        “The charm [found among the <em>Lacnunga</em>, instructs one to take seven little wafers like the ones people use to worship; i.e. the Host] and write down the names of seven saints (Maximianus, Malcus, Johannes, Martinianus, Dionysius, Constantinus and Serafion – the names of the Christian saints collectively known as the Seven Sleepers)] further instructs that a virgin must hang these wafers around the neck of the patient and that you are to sing a particular song, “ærest on þæt wynstre eare, þænne on þæt swiðre eare, þænne bufan þæs mannes moldan” [first into the left ear, then into the right ear, then on top of the patient’s head]. This ritual is to be repeated for three days in a row”<br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        So earworm a man to rid him of a dwarf – Interesting! Why would a medieval person have wanted to do such a thing?

                                        “The Old English word for dwarf, <em>dweorg</em>, could also denote “fever, perhaps high fever with delirium and convulsions” [<em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.doe.utoronto.ca/pages/index.html" target="_blank">Dictionary of Old English</a></em>, s.v. <em>dweorg</em>]”

                                        The blogpost offers the following as the generally accepted translation of Harley MS 585, fol. 167v
                                    </p><p>
                                        Here came a spider-creature crawling in;<br/>
                                        His web was a harness held in his hand.<br/>
                                        Stalking, he said that you were his steed.<br/>
                                        Then he threw his net around your neck,<br/>
                                        Reining you in. Then they both began<br/>
                                        To rise from the land, spring from the earth.<br/>
                                        As they leapt up, their limbs grew cool.<br/>
                                        Then the spider-dwarf’s sister jumped in,<br/>
                                        Ending it all by swearing these oaths:<br/>
                                        No hurt should come to harm the sick,<br/>
                                        No pain to the patient who receives the cure,<br/>
                                        No harm to the one who sings this charm.
                                    </p><p>

                                        I LOVE the image of a shady “spiderwiht” (awesome word) attempting to ride a man and making him writhe and convulse with fever as a result.

                                        I was also amused at the idea of using a skull fragment to inscribe the runes “DEAD IS DWERG” on as a talisman against dwarves, but, you know, I love my household, I’m sure I would never resort to such things..<br/>
