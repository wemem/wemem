        <p> Seoul-headquartered PV solar-cell manufacturing giant <a href="https://www.q-cells.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q Cells</a> today announced that it’s opening a new solar panel manufacturing facility in&nbsp;Dalton, Georgia. </p>
        <h2 id="h-georgia-solar-panel-manufacturing-grows-again"> Georgia solar panel manufacturing grows again </h2>
        <p> It’s a $171 million expansion of Q Cells’ existing solar module manufacturing plant in Dalton, and that will create 470 additional jobs. Total local Q Cells employees will exceed 1,000 when the expansion is complete. </p>
        <p> Groundbreaking is planned for fall 2022 and operation is expected to commence within the first half of 2023. </p>
        <p> This latest domestic solar manufacturing expansion will boost production of advanced photovoltaic (PV) modules, and that will help the US work move toward its goal of decarbonizing the electric grid. </p>
        <p> The new facility will produce 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of solar modules per year made with Q Cells’ next-gen PV cells, a high-efficiency tunnel oxide passivated contact technology better known as TOPCon. </p>
        <p> Combined with the existing 1.7-GW factory, the expansion will bring Q Cells’ total capacity in the US to 3.1 GW; that’s equivalent to one-third of the country’s solar module manufacturing capacity. </p>
        <p>Qcells CEO&nbsp;Justin Lee said:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p> Georgia&nbsp;has become the clean energy manufacturing heart of America, and we are proud to contribute to the state’s advanced manufacturing economy. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p> Q Cells has the largest market share in the US commercial and residential markets and also supplies the utility-scale solar sector. </p>
        <p> Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA)&nbsp;met with Q Cells’ parent company Hanwha&nbsp;in Seoul last year and has been actively pitching and securing additional clean energy investment in Georgia. </p>

        <p> Also in Georgia, <a href="https://wesolarcsp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WeSolar CSP</a>, a minority-owned renewable energy tech and design company headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, will design a solar farm along with a microgrid that will supply the City of Washington, Georgia, that will replace natural gas use. Washington is 90 miles east of Atlanta and has a population of around 4,000. </p>
        <p> The project will comprise both solar panels and a concentrating solar-thermal power (CSP) technology. </p>
        <p>WeSolar CSP’s CEO, Steve Anglin, said:</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p> The citizens of the City of Washington will benefit by having a cleaner environment and experiencing price certainty in the face of the ever-increasing energy costs of fossil fuels. </p>
