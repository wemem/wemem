              Seoul-headquartered PV solar-cell manufacturing giant
              <a href="https://www.q-cells.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Q Cells</a>
              today announced that it’s opening a new solar panel manufacturing
              facility in Dalton, Georgia.
            </p><h2>
              Georgia solar panel manufacturing grows again
            </h2><p>
              It’s a $171 million expansion of Q Cells’ existing solar module
              manufacturing plant in Dalton, and that will create 470 additional
              jobs. Total local Q Cells employees will exceed 1,000 when the
              expansion is complete.
            </p><p>
              Groundbreaking is planned for fall 2022 and operation is expected
              to commence within the first half of 2023.
            </p><p>
              This latest domestic solar manufacturing expansion will boost
              production of advanced photovoltaic (PV) modules, and that will
              help the US work move toward its goal of decarbonizing the
              electric grid.
            </p><p>
              The new facility will produce 1.4 gigawatts (GW) of solar modules
              per year made with Q Cells’ next-gen PV cells, a high-efficiency
              tunnel oxide passivated contact technology better known as TOPCon.
            </p><p>
              Combined with the existing 1.7-GW factory, the expansion will
              bring Q Cells’ total capacity in the US to 3.1 GW; that’s
              equivalent to one-third of the country’s solar module
              manufacturing capacity.
            </p><p>Qcells CEO Justin Lee said:</p><blockquote><p>
                Georgia has become the clean energy manufacturing heart of
                America, and we are proud to contribute to the state’s advanced
                manufacturing economy.
              </p></blockquote><p>
              Q Cells has the largest market share in the US commercial and
              residential markets and also supplies the utility-scale solar
              sector.
            </p><p>
              Senator Jon Ossoff (D-GA) met with Q Cells’ parent company
              Hanwha in Seoul last year and has been actively pitching and
              securing additional clean energy investment in Georgia.

              headquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, will design a solar farm
              along with a microgrid that will supply the City of Washington,
              Georgia, that will replace natural gas use. Washington is 90 miles
              east of Atlanta and has a population of around 4,000.
            </p><p>
              The project will comprise both solar panels and a concentrating
              solar-thermal power (CSP) technology.
            </p><p>WeSolar CSP’s CEO, Steve Anglin, said:</p><blockquote><p>
