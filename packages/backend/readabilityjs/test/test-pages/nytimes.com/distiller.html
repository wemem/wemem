                                    The social media company went public in 2013. But Elon
                                    Musk is taking it private as part of his acquisition of
                                    the firm. Here’s what that means.

                                            the complicated transaction.

                                            “I was really asking him about — did he find being
                                            private was good?” Mr. Musk recalled in a

                                            about the Tesla effort. “Did he regret going private?”
                                        </p><p>
                                            Mr. Dell warned Mr. Musk that it was “a very difficult
                                            process” but that he was glad to have done it,
                                            according to court filings.
                                        </p><p>
                                            Now, Mr. Musk, who did not end up taking Tesla
                                            private, is doing so with Twitter. As part of his $44
                                            billion acquisition of the social media service, which
                                            closed on Thursday, he is delisting the company’s
                                            stock and taking it out of the hands of public
                                            shareholders.
                                        </p><p>
                                            Making Twitter a private company gives Mr. Musk some
                                            advantages. Unlike publicly traded companies,
                                            privately held firms do not have to make quarterly
                                            public disclosures about their performance. They are
                                            also subject to less regulatory scrutiny and can be
                                            more tightly controlled by an owner. That means Mr.
                                            Musk can make over Twitter — including tweaking the
                                            platform’s content rules, its finances and its
                                            priorities — without having to consider the worries of
                                            the investing public.

                                            “It’s hard to run a public company if you think you
                                            should be the one running it and you’re not open to
                                            other views from people, like stockholders,” said
                                            Brian J.M. Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law
                                            School. “By taking it private, you feel like you have
                                            a lot more flexibility.”

                                            Here’s how Twitter is set to change as a private
                                            company under Mr. Musk.

                                            to handle the deal. X is buying out all of Twitter’s
                                            stock and will control the service, and Mr. Musk will

                                            The executives who were fired include
                                            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/29/technology/parag-agrawal-twitter.html" title="">Parag Agrawal</a>, Twitter’s chief executive, who has clashed publicly
                                            and privately with Mr. Musk. When Mr. Musk complained
                                            this year that Twitter had an unchecked spam problem,
                                            Mr. Agrawal tweeted to rebut his claims. Mr. Musk
                                            responded with a poop emoji.

                                            At another point, Mr. Agrawal texted Mr. Musk, telling
                                            the billionaire that his criticisms were harming
                                            Twitter, according to a

                                            “This is a waste of time,” Mr. Musk retorted.

                                            Other executives who were fired include Ned Segal,
                                            Twitter’s chief financial officer; Vijaya Gadde, the
                                            top legal and policy executive; and Sean Edgett, the
                                            general counsel.

                                            Under the merger agreement, Mr. Agrawal was
                                            potentially set to receive a golden parachute worth
                                            about $60 million, with Mr. Segal to receive $46
                                            million, while Ms. Gadde would receive about $20
                                            million. It was not immediately clear whether Mr. Musk
                                            intended to make the payments.

                                            What about Twitter’s employees?

                                            Twitter has about 7,500 employees. Some of them
                                            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/technology/twitter-employees-elon-musk.html" title="">have been jittery</a>
                                            for months about the company’s sale to Mr. Musk. Many
                                            could face layoffs or job changes as their new owner
                                            takes over.

                                            Their compensation is also set to change. Employees
                                            typically receive stock options in the company. But,
                                            with the delisting of Twitter’s stock, employees are
                                            set to be cashed out for shares they already have and
                                            to be paid with cash bonuses going forward, instead of
                                            the stock options they were scheduled to receive,
                                            according to the merger agreement. Some
                                            <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/21/technology/twitter-employees-elon-musk.html" title="">employees have worried</a>
                                            that Mr. Musk may not honor the agreement.

                                            “Most of these employees have been in a public company
                                            and are used to public option grants, which are
                                            liquid,” Mr. Quinn said. “They will have to come up
                                            with some other Silicon Valley-friendly method of
                                            keeping people around.”

                                            What financial pressures will Twitter face as a
                                            private company?

                                            By going private, Twitter will avoid some public
                                            scrutiny since it will no longer be required to make
                                            quarterly disclosures about the health of its
                                            business. This will give Mr. Musk some flexibility as
                                            he changes Twitter.
                                        </p><p>
                                            But he will face pressure from the banks that lent him
                                            $12.5 billion for the deal to begin repaying his debt.
                                            The cost of repaying those loans could run as high as
                                            $1 billion a year, financial analysts said.

                                            “He has less public pressure, but he has a lot of
                                            private pressure from the banks to make the payments,”
                                            Mr. Quinn said of Mr. Musk. “Like almost every other
                                            private-equity take-private, he’s going to need a
                                            manager who is very focused on operations, being lean
                                            and being able to pay the bills on a day-to-day
                                            basis.”

                                            Mr. Musk also took about $7.1 billion from equity
                                            investors to push the deal through. He may also face
                                            pressure from those investors, who might expect him to
                                            take Twitter public again at some point so that they
                                            can recoup their investment.

                                            In some take-private deals, owners have opted to sell
                                            branches of their companies to pay their debts. Mr.
                                            Musk could choose to do the same at Twitter.

                                            “It’s conceivable that some aspects of Twitter could
                                            potentially be carved off, sold off or spun off to
                                            raise money that could go toward paying the debt,” Mr.
                                            Talley said. “Twitter kind of is pared down to its
                                            core mission right now. They would have to get a
                                            little creative.”
