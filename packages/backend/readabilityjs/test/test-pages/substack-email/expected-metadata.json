  "excerpt": "We\n                            agreed to confine my wife to my son’s room. She was included in the\n                            democratic process because she’s the one with corona. And now every time she heads out\n                            for food, to use the restroom or to just change clothes, we go through a complex tetris of\n                            opening windows, dawning masks and maintaining social distancing. A weird thing in your own\n                            house. But we’ve survived lice, moths in the larder and even black mold - Berlin\n                            things. So we’ll get through this too - so far it’s been little more\n                                than a serious cold for her (YMMV). Since we’re all\n                            boostered, it will be interesting to see who is also felled by the virus. I’m fine for\n                            now (knocks on wooden floor).",
