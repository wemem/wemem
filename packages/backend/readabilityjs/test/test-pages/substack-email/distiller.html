                            agreed to confine my wife to my son’s room.</strong> She was included in the
                            democratic process because she’s the one with corona. And now every time she heads out
                            for food, to use the restroom or to just change clothes, we go through a complex tetris of
                            opening windows, dawning masks and maintaining social distancing. A weird thing in your own
                            house. But we’ve survived lice, moths in the larder and even black mold - Berlin
                            things. So <strong>we’ll get through this too - so far it’s been little more
                                than a serious cold for her (</strong>YMMV<strong>).</strong> Since we’re all
                            boostered, it will be interesting to see who is also felled by the virus. I’m fine for
                            now (knocks on wooden floor). </p><p>But it’s
                            also why this is a touch late today.</p><p>Enjoy the

                            New corona rules today (Friday)</h3><p>Why make it
                            easy when you can make it more complex? Corona regulations are generally passed by the
                            federal government and then have to be passed again at the state level, often with
                            inexplicable local flourishes, before becoming law. This creates a Germany-wide quilt of
                            differing regulations that few understand. This week is no different though Berlin has
                            decided to stretch the introduction over two days. Starting today in Berlin, <strong>people
                                in contact with an infected person no longer have to go into quarantine if they’ve
                                received a booster vaccination or belong to the new “fresh”
                                category</strong> - “freshly” vaccinated or recovered. “Fresh”
                            means within the past three months. Quarantine for other contact persons now ends after 10
                            days, rather than 14, and people can test out (rapid antibody or PCR) after 7 days. Is
                            anyone enforcing this?</p><h3>
                            New corona rules Saturday (tomorrow)</h3><p><strong>FFP2
                            masks are now mandatory on public transport,</strong> so keep the surgical masks until the
                            next time politicians change their minds (the only constant in this pandemic). Bars and
                            restaurants are also 2G plus, which means recently recovered or vaccinated PLUS a same-day
                            negative test result or proof of a booster vaccination. This applies to any other indoor
                            events with more than 10 people as well. </p><h3>
                            Kotti police station</h3><p>You know when
                            an aging celebrity dies and you think, Oh, I thought they were already dead? Same feeling
                            when you hear <strong>they’re going to open a police station at Kotti</strong>. You
                            mean there wasn’t one already? The fuzz want to build a new 300-square-meter cop shop

The
                            activist artists last summer created a fake flyer distribution company and convinced the
                            right-wing AfD to hire them to distribute 5 million election-related flyers. The artists
                            then destroyed the pamphlets. The artist is reportedly accused of falsifying documents that
                            could be used to secure official documents. The center decried the raid on Twitter and its

                            cars were registered in the <em>Haupstadt</em> last year, compared with 65,900 in 2020 and

                            to consultancy EY. <strong>2021 was a record for the city’s startups, bringing in
                                €10.5 billion in fresh money</strong>, €7 billion more than in 2020. Where’s
