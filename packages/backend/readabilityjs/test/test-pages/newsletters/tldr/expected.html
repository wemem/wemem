                    </a></p>
                <p> Elon Musk apparently vetoed plans for Tesla to build a $25,000 electric car in favor of developing robotaxis. He finally relented when aides revealed a plan to build both a robotaxi and an inexpensive small car side by side. A $25,000 electric car would be a game changer for the auto industry. Tesla's Master Plan always called for using money made from early models to bring down the cost of future vehicles. </p>

                <p> The life expectancy of someone in the US infected with HIV is currently about the same as the rest of the population. This is largely due to antiretroviral therapy, a daily treatment regimen that decreases the level of HIV in a person's blood to the point it's no longer detectable or transmittable. There have been a handful of people over the last couple of decades that have been able to reach undetectable HIV levels while off treatment, essentially meaning they've been cured of the disease. New universal cures are now on the horizon. </p>
