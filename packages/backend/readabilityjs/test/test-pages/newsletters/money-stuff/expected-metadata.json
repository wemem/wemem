My basic point was that Gensler wants\n                  the SEC to have jurisdiction over basically all of crypto,\n                  because basically every crypto token is a security, but that\n                  he does not seem to have any interest in writing new rules to\n                  accommodate the crypto market. Genslerâ€™s approach would put\n                  the SEC in charge of crypto, and then more or less ban crypto,\n                  and I am not sure that is a winning position for him to take.",
