            <p> I was bullish this week at 4200/4300 with the view the market may balance between 4200 and 4500 for quite some time and I was quite right in this assumption as the market made multiple attempts to take out 4200 and failed each time. </p>
            <p> This week’s installment of the Weekly Plan I will try to figure out if this assumption still stands, various factors that support this assumptions as well as the factors which may be indicating that there may be more sell off coming ahead. </p>

            <p> Without much ado, let us dive into the chart of S&amp;P500 Emini (Chart A). This is the 5 auctions of this past week, each graphically representing the frustrations of sellers as they tried to break the lows. Each one of these levels and my context was shared in 5 Daily newsletters this past week. Posts are sent every day around 4 PM, after market close. </p>
            <p> From a 10000 feet view, this chart below shows me while the lows were fought bitterly for and won by the bulls, the bulls are not necessarily out of the danger here yet. Read on to find out why I think so. </p>

            <p> More than half of the Nasdaq stocks have been cut in half in market cap. Majority, as many as 75-80% are now trading below their 200 DMA . These stats are not exactly the cheerleaders of strong bull markets, if any thing they showcase the carnage that has been done and portends possibly more. </p>
            <p> See below chart B for the 5 Day Auction in erstwhile momentum sweetheart $ARKK. Cathie and her ETF has fallen from graces and is now in the dumps. I was bear on this at 125 and is now cut in half, last traded lows around 65 bucks. </p>
            <p> Can it rise from here? This profile chart certainly seems to indicate that to me. But not without a fight, and a little help from the FED. </p>

            <p> Fundamentals and earnings aside, S&amp;P500 is impacted by nothing more than geopolitics and FED liquidity or lack thereof. 10 year yields are a very good indicator of FED tightening or easing. And I use TLT quite a bit as a gauge of this. </p>
            <p> TLT has been stubborn to trade below that vaunted 140 all this week, rallying on Friday, and taking the equities with it. This chart C certainly suggests there may be more juice to this. </p>

            <p> Friday was a very good day for the equities. Capping off a tumultuous week. It reinforced my opinion that prices below 4200 will be harder to achieve per my trade plans from last week. I turned out to be right and we closed right above the 200 DMA at 4425. Here is the link to my trade plan from last week, in case you have not read it yet: <a href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxVkU2K5DAMhU8T7yrE_8nCi4GhrxEcW5WYSuxgy13k9uPqzKZBSPAk8cQnZxHWlC9zpoLkk2a8TjAR3mUHRMikFshz8EYzqbVmlHgjPB3lSEKZnxngsGE3mCuQsy57cBZDip8NyalQlGxmkUp6obTwavQjWMGdk5OfFquVHBZ_G9vqA0QHBr4hXykC2c2GeJaO_-nYVwsMDpPDbH2Ia1_qUtC6V-_S0ZrnPVAeb4DXfj1wS3XdsDwo4x3_yh3_W19pkh1TFY_Z2eO0YY1N_rj_Vw_woR5Ne8NCgmEDYwNlE9WM0aFnPQDV6jkNw-TY03HWH99xXdSpOjEcK_t1E8mmXP27bktrrh9KP2qDNLd61BjwmiHaZQd_88P7DT9E5xUi5PYeP1s0VAkutJr4JEd-42qAhZ4GpoUkzdanthXNL0T_ACOkogA" rel="">PAST WEEKLY PLAN</a>
            </p>
            <p> Looking ahead, I am cautiously bullish into dips. At this point in time, I do not see evidence that suggests there will be earth shattering moves either on the downside or to the upside. </p>
            <p> My current thinking is that we could balance here between 4200-4500 for few more days before a break higher into 4600-4700. Remember my thinking is not informed by any charts or technical analysis but it is heavily influenced by the order flow. These are the actual orders that hit the tape every day. Order flow can and does change at any time due to macro factors or sudden events. Therefore my opinion can change at any time as a result. However, if we assume the current factors stay in homeostasis, then I have no reason to suspect 4200-4500 thesis is not intact this coming week. </p>

                <strong>These are the main factors which I think support bullish action:</strong>
            </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Seasonality:</strong> this is the tax season. There is a natural tailwind for stocks due to various type of tax events, whether that is 401, IRA contributions or rebalancing.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Money Velocity:</strong> while CPI has run rampant, the money supply has been in the dumps. This suggests the inflation problem is more demand driven than systemic. Think of money velocity as how many times the same dollar bill changes hands. When the same dollar bill goes from person to person or business to business, several times, it creates more money velocity and IMO those type of movement create persistent inflation problems like we had in the 1980s.

                        <strong>Current inflation situation</strong> is due in most part to destruction of supply channels. Demand is there but for how long is any one’s guess. I see as more and more coronavirus restrictions are taken off, the supply may overwhelm the system, driving down the prices. That may be next month, that may be months from now. However looking at mid terms and political scene, I think that is closer than you think.

                        <strong>Valuations:</strong> Valuations of some of the bellwether stocks like GOOGL, have already been cut down quite a bit! It is trading at a forward p/e of 19 and I thought at 2500 it was ridiculous! So there is that… yes more sell may come but once GOOGL starts trading at 2300-2500 you oughta think, “man this is silly!”

                        <strong>Ten year yields</strong> have come off the highs. I think they will find a balance between 1.7-2 % and that will not be too extreme for the equities.

                        <strong>FED FED FED:</strong> despite the uncertainty around inflation, Powell was adamant about pulling liquidity out of the system . FED is the ultimate LP (liquidity provider) . No liquidity = no stock market. Less liquidity = lesser stock market. I think the way a lot of funds read him is he wants lower stock prices. Lower stock prices are deflationary by nature . So even though the inflation may cool down, if enough people believe Powell wants lower stock market that becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p> Monday: Chicago PMI and FED Speak. </p>
                </li>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> Friday: Non FARM Payroll Report (NFP) AND Wage Inflation numbers. </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p> The theme of these events for me will be to see if we are beginning to see the inflation numbers come down or are they still surprising to the upside. Same for wage inflation numbers. With regards to actual job growth, I think we are now in a phase of market where good news is bad for stocks and bad news is good for stocks. So any miss in the NFP number may be perceived to be good for stocks . </p>
            <p> Expectation is 166 K jobs added. </p>
            <h2> With this context and background, here is how I am technically preparing for next week’s trading: </h2>
            <p> I suspect Friday’s late rally was driven by short squeeze. If so, we may find sellers here at 4430-4454. Key level for me for the week ahead is 4360. </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p> On Monday if we open or offer below 4360, I think more softness may develop, testing the lows at 4288/4300. I will validate this with the Tic TOP indicator and TRIN.

                <li>
                    <p> Break of 4288 will become a bearish event for me and may target recent swing lows at 4210. </p>

                <li>
                    <p> In an unlikely event of an open or bids above 4411 on Monday AM, I will be bullish for a test of 4450-4456. Validated with Tic TOP indicator. </p>

                <li>

            <h2> Earnings next week: </h2>
            <p> There are tremendous earnings next week with GOOG, AMZN, FB, XOM being a few of them.. </p>
            <p> Keeping in line with my prior analysis of the general market conditions, these stocks while attractive, may find some selling action as well. </p>
            <h2> AMZN </h2>
            <p> Amazon specifically, last traded a high of 2900. This stock BTW which I shared at 2700 before a 200 point zipper, if this drops into 2500-2621 on earnings induced swoon may be a buy for me. </p>
            <h2> HD </h2>
            <p> Home Depot which was my TOP stock in 2021 has been a victim of recent sell as well. I did not notice earlier it had fallen to the 350 lows recently and if it revisits those lows, I want to be in. Last traded 366. </p>
            <h2> XOM </h2>
            <p> This stock shared by me at 60 has been on a tear and could be headed a bit higher after earnings as it makes a climactic high. Last traded 75, in my opinion this may test 82-84 if 68/69 held. </p>
            <h2> FB </h2>
            <p> FaceBook has run into some execution issues especially with their desperate foray into Meta and Crypto NFT space. I do not know if this is temporary glitch or systemic issue with leadership/execution. However, I am on alert to see if this stock falls below 274/280 on earnings (last traded 301). If it does , I do want to dip my toes in it and see if it holds. </p>

                <li>
                    <p> I was bullish on S&amp;P500 at the lows last week and was proven to be right as the market staged an impressive 200 point rally off the lows. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> While longer term bullish for a test of 4700, I do not think the market is out of the woods yet as may chop around due to technical and lack of clarity on a few important data prints. </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p> That clarity may come this week with flailing inflation and falling NFP numbers. Market paradigm may shift to “<em><strong>Bad news is good news</strong></em>”. Do not get shafted when the paradigm shifts. Markets are forward looking, they do not make next moves on yesterdays news. </p>
                </li>

                        <strong>Investor Tic</strong> is liking the sale being offered on Big Tech names like GOOG, TSLA, AMZN, FB, HD and will buy more if they fall more. Investor Tic time frame is very long (10 years +) with the money he does not need neither today nor a year from now.
