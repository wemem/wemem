These severities were assessed by us for summarization purposes and are dependent on a mix of CVSS and our understanding of the business related impact.

                                                                        </h2>

                                                                            While scrolling through Twitter sometime around July I noticed a blog post being shared where a researcher was awarded $100,000 from Apple for discovering an authentication bypass that allowed them to arbitrarily access any Apple customer account. This was surprising to me as I previously understood that Apple's bug bounty program only awarded security vulnerabilities affecting their physical products and did not payout for issues affecting their web assets.

                                                                        </p>

At the time I had never worked on the Apple bug bounty program so I didn't really have any idea what to expect but decided why not try my luck and see what I could find.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p>
                                                                            In order to make the project more fun I sent a few messages to hackers I'd worked with in the past and asked if they'd like to work together on the program. Even though there was no guarantee regarding payouts nor an understanding of how the program worked, everyone said yes, and we began hacking on Apple.

Both Ben and Tanner were the experts here, so they began figuring out what all Apple owned that was accessible to us. All of the results from their scanning were indexed in a dashboard that included the HTTP status code, headers, response body, and screenshot of the accessible web servers under the various domains owned by Apple that we’d refer to over the engagement.

Our time was primarily spent on the 17.0.0.0/8 IP range, .apple.com, and .icloud.com since that was where the interesting functionality appeared to be.

This was an invitation-only Jive forum where users could authenticate using their Apple account. Something interesting about this forum was that some of the core Jive functionality to register to the app was ported through a custom middleware page built by Apple in order to connect their authentication system (IDMSA) to the underlying Jive forum which normally used username/password authentication.

You would simply use the “Sign In With Apple” and be logged into the forum.

This would allow the Jive forum to know who you were based on your IDMSA cookie since it tied your email address belonging to your Apple account to the forum.
                                                                            </p>

When you submitted your application that included your username, first and last name, email address, and employer, you were also submitting a “password” value which was then secretly tied to your account sourced from a hidden input field on the page.
                                                                            </p>

We investigated this because the password was the same for each one of us on our separate registrations.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

When we manually formed the test HTTP request to authenticate to the Apple Distinguished Developers application, we found that it attempted to authenticate us by displaying an incorrect password error. When we used our own accounts that we had previously applied with, the application errored out and did not allow us to authenticate as we were not yet approved. We would have to find the username of an already approved member if we wanted to authenticate.

We were in! From this point, our next goal was to authenticate as someone with elevated permissions. We took a few screenshots of our access and clicked the “Users” list to view which users were administrators. We logged into the first account we saw on the list in an attempt to prove we could achieve remote code execution via the administrative functionality, however, there were still a few roadblocks ahead.

This was strange, as it was custom behavior for the Jive application and none of us had observed this before. Our guess was that Apple had restricted the administration console based on IP address to make sure that there was never a full compromise of the application.
                                                                            </p>

The next thing we tried was to load a different form of “/admin/” in-case the application had path specific blacklists for accessing the administrator console.
                                                                            </p>

We automated this bypass by setting up a Burp Suite rule which automatically changed “GET/POST /admin/” to “GET/POST /admin;/” in our HTTP requests.

We did not have access to the normal functionality that would demonstrate remote code execution (there was no templating, plugin upload, nor the standard administrative debugging functionality).

We went ahead and authenticated to 2-3 more accounts before finally authenticating as the core administrator and seeing functionality that would allow for remote code execution.

                                                                            </p>

The "reset password" page counted as a page itself, so in order to let us use it, the application automatically logged us into an account that was capable of using the page.
                                                                            </p>

After a while, we sent an HTTP request to an OAuth endpoint in an attempt to generate an authorization bearer that we could use to explore the API. This was successful!
                                                                            </p>

None of these required authentication beyond the initial authorization bearer we initially sent. The operations disclosed here included things like...

                                                                            </p>

                                                                                The above format (after the fact) appears very simple and easy to understand, but at the time of hacking we had absolutely no idea how to form this call. I had even tried emailing the company who provided the software asking how you were supposed to form these API calls, but they wouldn't respond to my email because I didn't have a subscription to the service.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                I'd spent nearly 6 hours trying to figure out how to form the above API call, but after we figured it out, it was very much smooth sailing. The "create employee" function required various parameters that relied on UUIDs, but we were able to retrieve these via the other "Operations" and fill them in as we went along.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                                About two hours more, we finally formed the following API request:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>POST /Apriso/HttpServices/api/platform/1/Operations/redacted HTTP/1.1

This website works as an automatic storage mechanism for photos, videos, documents, and app related data for Apple products. Additionally, this platform provides services like Mail and Find my iPhone.
                                                                            </p>

Additionally, there is a mail app on both iOS and Mac which is installed by default on the products. The mail service is hosted on “www.icloud.com” alongside all of the other services like file and document storage.
                                                                            </p>

We began to look for any cross-site scripting issues at this point.
                                                                            </p>

When the service receives an email and a user opens it, the data is processed into a JSON blob which is sanitized and picked apart by JavaScript and then displayed to the user.
                                                                            </p>

This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, but simplifies the process of identifying XSS by understanding what specifically we’ll need to break within the source code.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </h3>
                                                                            <p>

This tag is interesting as the DOM will only cancel this element with an end “&lt;/style&gt;” tag. This means that if we wrote “&lt;style&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/style&gt;” and it was fully rendered in the DOM, there would be no alert prompt as the content of the tag is strictly CSS and the script tag was stuffed within the tag and not beyond the closing tag.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                From a sanitization perspective, the only things Apple would need to worry about here would be an ending style tag, or if there was sensitive information on the page, CSS injection via import chaining.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                I decided to focus on trying to break out of the style tag without Apple realizing it since it would be a very straightforward stored XSS if achievable.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                I played around with this for a while trying various permutations and eventually observed something interesting: when you had two style tags within the email, the contents of the style tags would be concatenated together into one style tag. This meant that if we could get “&lt;/sty” into the first tag and “le&gt;” into the second tag, it would be possible to trick the application into thinking our tag was still open when it really wasn’t.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </div>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                At this point we decided the coolest proof of concept would be something which steals all of the victim’s personal information (photos, calendar information, and documents) then forwards the same exploit to all of their contacts.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <div class="wp-block-image"></div>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                We built a neat PoC which would return the photo URLs from the iCloud API, stick them into image tags, and then append a list of contacts for the user account underneath them. This demonstrated that it was possible to retrieve the values, but in order to exfiltrate them we would have to bypass a CSP which meant no easy outbound HTTP requests to anything but “.apple.com” and a few other domains.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                Luckily for us, the service is a mail client. We can simply use JavaScript to invoke an email to ourselves, attach the iCloud photo URLs and contacts, then fire away all of the victim’s signed iCloud photo and document URLs.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                The following video demonstrates a proof of concept whereas a victim’s photos are stolen. In a full exploitation scenario performed by a malicious party, an attacker could silently steal all of the victim’s photos, videos, and documents, then forward the modified email to the victim’s contact list and worm the cross-site scripting payload against the iCloud mail service.

                                                                            </h3>

                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                One thing I’ll always check with these sorts of semi-HTML applications is how they handle hyperlinks. It seems intuitive to automatically turn an unmarked URL into a hyperlink, but it can get messy if it isn’t being sanitized properly or is combined with other functionalities. This is a common place to look for XSS due to the reliance on regex, innerHTML, and all of the accepted elements you can add alongside the URL.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                The second piece of interesting functionality for this XSS is the total removal of certain tags like “&lt;script&gt;” and “&lt;iframe&gt;”. This one is neat because certain things will rely on characters like space, tabs, and new lines whereas the void left by the removed tag can provide those characters without telling the JavaScript parser. These indifferences allow for attackers to confuse the application and sneak in malicious characters which can invoke XSS.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                I played around with both of these functionalities for a while (automatic hyperlinking and the total removal of certain tags) until deciding to combine the two and attempt to see how they behaved together. To my surprise, the following string broke the hyperlinking functionality and confused the DOM:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https://www.domain.com/abc#&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;https://domain.com/abc</code></pre>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                After sending the above by itself within an email, the content was parsed to the following:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;a href="https://www.domain.com/abc#&lt;a href=" https:="" www.domain.com="" abc="&amp;quot;" rel="noopener noreferrer"&gt;https://www.domain.com/abc&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                This was very interesting to see initially, but exploiting it would be a bit harder. It is easy to define the attributes within the tag (e.g. src, onmouseover, onclick, etc.) but providing the values would be difficult as we still had to match the URL regex so it wouldn’t escape the automatic hyperlinking functionality. The payload that eventually worked without sending single quotes, double quotes, parenthesis, spaces, or backticks was the following:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>https://www.icloud.com/mail/#&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt;https://www.icloud.com/onmouseover=location=/javascript:alert%28document.domain%29/.source;//</code></pre>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                The payload produced this in the DOM:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <pre class="wp-block-code"><code>&lt;a href="https://www.icloud.com/mail#&lt;a href=" https:="" www.icloud.com="" onmouseover="location=/javascript:alert%28document.domain%29/.source;//&amp;quot;"&gt;https://www.icloud.com/onmouseover=location=/javascript:alert%28document.domain%29/.source;//&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>
                                                                            <p>

                                                                            </p>

The files you upload get propagated to various Apple services such as iTunes where people can download or purchase them. This seemed like a good vector for customer XSS and blind XSS against employees.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

Funny enough, the first epub file we grabbed was an epub version 1 format with invalid xhtml. The publish tool spit out a huge wall of text of errors to let us know why it failed to upload/validate.

We started with iTunes Connect, started exploring Books, and continued to branch out until we fully understood what services exist around that single feature.

Without exploring the help docs, you may have missed the web epub app entirely as it is a single link on one page.

We found nearly a dozen blind or semi-blind SSRFs, but had a terribly hard time trying to find any way to retrieve the response. This was incredibly frustrating as during our recon process we found tons of references to what appeared to be awesome internal applications for source code management, user management, information lookup, and customer support.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

When you submitted the form to do this, it sent an HTTP request containing a URL parameter which included the URL of the mail file attachment in the request. If you attempted to modify this URL to something arbitrary, the request would fail and give a “400 Bad Request” error. The process would create a “job” where the response of the HTTP request was converted into an Apple Pages document, then opened in a new tab.

The process would convert the raw HTML to an Apple pages file then display it to us in a new window. This was a bit annoying to fuzz with, so Brett ended up throwing together a python script to automate the process.

                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

Going back to our recon data, we noticed that there is a nova.apple.com.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

So the next step was to create a book with &lt;script src=””&gt; in the name to start playing around with the XSS in the image generation process.
                                                                            </p>

From here we discovered that <strong>/viewer/actuator</strong> responded with all of the actuator endpoints including mapping and heapdump.

                                                                            </p>

It was at this point that we realized the actuator endpoints were vulnerable in each app folder on all esign subdomains. From here we grabbed a heapdump from ensign-internal.
                                                                            </p>

We also noticed that the acack cookie was authenticating us to other applications as well.

It’s important to remember that just because you aren’t finding them commonly, they’re still out there and on big targets just waiting to be found by an attacker.

Additionally we did not know the expected XML format structure (preventing a non-blind XXE exploit).

It was surprising exploiting this one because to achieve blind XXE as it was very straightforward compared to all of the complicated ways we’d tried to identify it over time.
                                                                            </p>

Keywords: query, limit, offset, column names, filter, etc. Making one tiny change to see what happens, we got the following:

Some important parts were the extra "*/*/" closing comments in limit due to stacking queries. We also had to use /**/ between FROM and table as vSQL has some protections built into it against SQL injection.

                                                                            </p>

                                                                                <a href="https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/s3export.htm">https://www.vertica.com/docs/9.2.x/HTML/Content/Authoring/SQLReferenceManual/Functions/VerticaFunctions/s3export.htm</a>
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

This included some API endpoints for pulling cluster data, application data, and possibly even deploying new clusters and applications.
                                                                            </p>

However, we didn’t prove it out due to the risk. We reported it and stopped here.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>

This would allow you to create leader-boards and manage locales for your application. If you enabled this, you were redirected to a more older looking page which used a new set of identifiers to manage the new game center/locale settings you can add to your app.

By modifying the number, we could access and modify the leader-boards of any app. This would allow an attacker to deface or remove entirely the game center settings from the app.

The user management was primarily done through the iOS app which you weren’t able to intercept without finding an SSL pinning bypass, so we decided to look at the other applications like Find my Friends and Photos which integrated sub-functionality for the parent/child relationship.

Within the HTTP response, the family members email was returned. I went ahead and modified this value to another user’s ID and to my surprise received their email.

Since the parameter was sent via a JSON array, you could request hundreds of identifiers at a time and easily enumerate a massive amount of user IDs belonging to Apple customers.

There were a lot of really interesting apps and APIs on the actual device, but many of the domains belonging to Apple were SSL pinned and none of us had a strong enough mobile background nor the significant amount of time required to pick apart the actual iOS device.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                The way in which we did this was setting up the Burp proxy, installing the certificate, then connecting to the WiFi which had the Burp Proxy enabled whenever we got to a page that we wanted to try to intercept. An example of this would be the failure to load the core App Store while proxying all HTTP requests, but ability to load the app store while not proxying, navigating to the correct sub-page you want to intercept, then enabling the proxy at that point.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                                This allowed us to capture many API calls for the Apple owned apps that were installed by default on the iPhone. One of these was a support app for scheduling support or speaking with a live chat agent.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>

You were able to retrieve information about the victim’s support case details (what support they had requested, their device serial number, their user ID) and additionally a token that appeared to be used when requesting live chat with support agents.

This service was designed for employees of companies that produced third party electronic accessories that interfaced with the iPhone to retrieve documentation and support for their manufacturing process.

We went ahead and incremented the parameter via minus one and observed we could access another company's application.
                                                                            </p>

A simple estimate based on our most recent ID and the base ID indicated around 50,000 different retrievable applications through this vulnerability.

These applications would've allowed an attacker to at the very least exfiltrate a large amount of sensitive information regarding internal Apple logistics and employees/users.

This was originally meant to be a side project that we'd work on every once in a while, but with all of the extra free time with the pandemic we each ended up putting a few hundred hours into it.
                                                                        </p>

                                                                            Overall, Apple was very responsive to our reports. The turn around for our more critical reports was only four hours between time of submission and time of remediation.
                                                                        </p>

Apple has had an interesting history working with security researchers, but it appears that their vulnerability disclosure program is a massive step in the right direction to working with hackers in securing assets and allowing those interested to find and report vulnerabilities.
                                                                        </p>

                                                                            Writing this blog post has been an interesting process as we were a bit unsure how to actually go about doing it. To be honest, each bug we found could've probably been turned into a full writeup with how much random information there was. The authentication system Apple uses was fairly complex and to reference it with 1-2 sentences felt as if we were cheating someone out of information. The same thing could be said about many elements within Apple's infrastructure like iCloud, the Apple store, and the Developer platform.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p>

                                                                        </p>
