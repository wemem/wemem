        <p>

        <div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM">
            <pre>The old liberal embrace of inclusive debate that reflected the country’s breadth of views had given way to a new intolerance for the opinions of roughly half of American voters. </pre>

            <pre><span>After the profile of the Ohio man [who had attended the rally in Charlottesville, Virginia] was published, media Twitter lit up with attacks on the article as “normalising” Nazism and white nationalism, and the </span><em>Times </em><span>convulsed internally. The </span><em>Times </em><span>wound up publishing a cringing editor’s note that hung the writer out to dry …. [T]he very headline of the piece – “A Voice of Hate in America’s Heartland” – undermined the claim that it was “glowing”. </span></pre>

            <em>Hilarious – the Times gets some guy canceled for objecting to the destruction of a Robert E. Lee statue, and Times staffers are mad that the piece wasn’t vicious enough.</em>

            <pre>Empathetic reporting about Trump supporters became even more rare.

        <div data-component-name="PreformattedTextBlockToDOM">

            <pre><span>The </span><em>Times</em><span> was </span><strong>slow to break it to its readers</strong><span> that there was less to Trump’s ties to Russia than they were hoping, and more to Hunter Biden’s laptop, that Trump might be right that covid came from a Chinese lab, that masks were not always effective against the virus, that shutting down schools for many months was a bad idea.</span></pre>
