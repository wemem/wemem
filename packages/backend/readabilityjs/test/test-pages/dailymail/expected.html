            </div>
            <p> Foster and McPhee currently live in the music producer and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum's LA apartment, but it's not clear whether he will be selling up. </p>
            <p> The two couples have become firm friends since Harry and Meghan moved to California. </p>
            <p> And they enjoyed a cozy dinner date together in Montecito last week to celebrate McPhee's pregnancy. </p>
            <p> The outing was the first glimpse of the Duke, 36, and Duchess of Sussex, 39, in Montecito since DailyMail.com exclusively revealed they had moved into a sprawling $14 million mansion in the leafy Californian town. </p>
            <p> The couple bought the mansion, known as 'The Chateau', for $14.65 million on June 18, making them neighbors with celebrities Oprah Winfrey and Ellen DeGeneres. </p>
            <p> The 14,563-square-foot home, known as 'The Chateau', sits on 5.4 acres of land and immaculately clipped hedges border the estate's stone-pillared entry gates. </p>
            <p> Foster, a 16-time Grammy winning composer and music producer, and McPhee have a few properties to choose from in the area.<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>

            <p> The sprawling estate, owned by Monica Allyn, the wife of film producer Rob Allyn, came on the market earlier this month. </p>
            <p> If that's too pricey then a smaller, but more modern $6.4million architectural estate is also on offer, boasting a swimming pool and 4,000 sq ft of space. </p>
            <p> But if they're looking for something a little more cozy, then there's a beautiful single-level, town home also on the market, a snip at $2.3million. </p>
            <p> Harry and Meghan have bonded with Foster and McPhee since leaving the royal family and arriving in California. </p>
            <p> Also new to the neighborhood are&nbsp;<a href="http://fakehost/tvshowbiz/katy_perry/index.html" id="mol-8f2fd630-149d-11eb-8a5b-cfdff1f3bd96">Katy Perry</a> and Orlando Bloom who snapped up an exquisite compound in Montecito<a href="http://fakehost/news/california/index.html" id="mol-8f2fd631-149d-11eb-8a5b-cfdff1f3bd96"></a> for $14.2 million. </p>
            <p> The couple, who welcomed daughter Daisy Dove in August, purchased the stunning ocean view home from former Duracell and Chrysler CEO C. Robert Kidder, who owned the estate for over 20 years, according to <a rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" href="https://variety.com/2020/dirt/entertainers/katy-perry-orlando-bloom-buy-14-2-million-montecito-compound-1234811052/#">Variety</a>.&nbsp; </p>
            <p> The couple's gated property consists of multiple structures sitting upon 8.9 acres of land and will be situated among Hollywood's elite.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>

            <p> Foster, who is more than 30-years older than his wife, Harry and Meghan, is often referred to as a father figure for Prince Harry. </p>
            <p> McPhee and Foster's baby will be her first child and his sixth. </p>
            <p> Foster has five daughters and has been married five times: to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson, Yolanda Hadid and McPhee. </p>
            <p> The couple was married in London on June 28, 2019. </p>
            <p> Another selling point of Montecito for Foster is he's a long time friend of Oprah Winfrey. </p>
            <p> McPhee recently resumed filming on her upcoming Netflix series Country Comfort. </p>
            <p> Last month the actress shared a photo of a masked table read with the cast, captioning it, 'and we're back!'&nbsp; </p>

            <p> Another photo showed a monitor on set capturing her breaking into laughter with her costar Eddie Cibrian. </p>
            <p> The two were announced to star in the series in January, but production was halted in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. </p>
            <p> The Sussexes stepped down as senior working royals on March 31 and although they initially moved to Canada - living in a mansion Foster had set them up with for free -they have since set up home in California. </p>
            <p> The couple first lived in Tyler Perry's sprawling $18 million hilltop mansion in Beverly Hills before buying a home in Montecito. </p>
