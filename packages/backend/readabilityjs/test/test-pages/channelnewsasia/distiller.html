                                                                        SINGAPORE: On top of meeting a minimum qualifying salary, foreigners wanting to work in Singapore under an Employment Pass (EPs) will also have to meet a minimum score under a points system from September next year.
                                                                    </p><p>

For the financial sector, the salary benchmark is set higher at S$5,500.
                                                                    </p><h2>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><h2>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><figure><img src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--yEmziZKn--/f_auto%2Cq_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2022/03/04/20220303-compass.png?itok=CZgUtvc_" alt=""/></figure><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

They will get another 10 points under the “Qualifications” attribute if they hold a degree or its equivalent.
                                                                    </p><h2>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

It scores 0 if the proportion is more than 25 per cent, and 20 points if it is less than 5 per cent.
                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><figure><img src="https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--kwKhV4qM--/f_auto%2Cq_auto/v1/mediacorp/cna/image/2022/03/04/20220303-scoring.png?itok=chxEUekv" alt=""/></figure><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>

                                                                    </p><p>
