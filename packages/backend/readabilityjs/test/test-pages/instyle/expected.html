            <p> Call it quarantine boredom or an unstoppable trend, but in 2020, it feels like everyone is <a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/bella-hadid-bangs-quarantine-haircut">getting bangs</a>. And this week, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> is adding her name to the list. </p>
            <p> On Tuesday, the model was spotted out and about in New York City f<a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/gigi-hadid/gigi-hadid-bella-hadid-baby-out-nyc">or the first time since giving birth</a> to her and Zayn Malik's daughter. In the photos of said walk, we couldn't help but notice the inches (!!!) on her long blonde hair </p>
            <p> The length didn't last long, however, because just a day later Hadid took to Instagram to show off her brand new hairstyle, complete with perfect wispy bangs. "fresh snow, fresh cut," she wrote in the caption. She also tagged her stylist, Allie Hernandez. </p>

            <p> Unsurprisingly, Gigi isn't the first Hadid to get new risky bangs during quarantine. Her sister Bella showed off a new style (THAT SHE CUT HERSELF) back in April. </p>
