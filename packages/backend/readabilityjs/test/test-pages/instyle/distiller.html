                                    Call it quarantine boredom or an unstoppable trend, but in 2020, it feels like everyone is <a href="https://www.instyle.com/news/bella-hadid-bangs-quarantine-haircut">getting bangs</a>. And this week, <a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/gigi-hadid">Gigi Hadid</a> is adding her name to the list.

                                    On Tuesday, the model was spotted out and about in New York City f<a href="https://www.instyle.com/celebrity/gigi-hadid/gigi-hadid-bella-hadid-baby-out-nyc">or the first time since giving birth</a> to her and Zayn Malik&#39;s daughter. In the photos of said walk, we couldn&#39;t help but notice the inches (!!!) on her long blonde hair

                                    The length didn&#39;t last long, however, because just a day later Hadid took to Instagram to show off her brand new hairstyle, complete with perfect wispy bangs. &#34;fresh snow, fresh cut,&#34; she wrote in the caption. She also tagged her stylist, Allie Hernandez.

                                    Unsurprisingly, Gigi isn&#39;t the first Hadid to get new risky bangs during quarantine. Her sister Bella showed off a new style (THAT SHE CUT HERSELF) back in April.
