                  For decades, people have claimed that homelessness is just a
                  housing problem. Sure, many also have substance use and mental
                  illness issues. But if we just give homeless people their own
                  own studio apartments, and decriminalize public camping,
                  drugs, and shoplifting, the problem will go away, many
                  claimed.

                  That hasn’t happened. Instead, the open drug scenes have
                  worsened. Nationally, drug overdoses and poisonings increased
                  from 17,000 in 2000 to 108,000 in 2021. And California, which
                  pioneered the “Housing First”/decriminalization
                  approach saw its homeless population increase 31% between 2011
                  and 2020, even as homelessness declined 18% in the rest of the
                  country.

                  I debunked the lies about homelessness in
                  <em>San Fransicko</em>, in hundreds of articles, and on dozens
                  of TV and podcast appearances. But when it comes to educating
                  the public, nothing has been more impactful than the video
                  interviews of homeless people that I’ve conducted over
                  the last few months with my friend Leighton Woodhouse, a
                  documentary filmmaker, as part of my run to become governor of
                  California.
                </p><p>
                  Now Leighton has assembled those interviews into a two-minute
                  20 second video we’ve posted on Twitter. It’s a
                  must-watch. It’s only been on-line for a few hours, and
                  over 130,000 people have seen it.
