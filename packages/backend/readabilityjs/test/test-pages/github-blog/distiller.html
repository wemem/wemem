                At GitHub we use GitHub to build our own products, and the new
                projects experience is no different. Check out how our team uses
                projects to build powerful project planning for developers.

              At GitHub, we use GitHub to build our own products, whether that
              be

                majority of GitHub.com development</a>, or
              <a href="https://youtu.be/MW0V5Q9WJu4">utilizing GitHub Actions to coordinate our GitHub Mobile
                releases</a>. And while GitHub Issues has been a part of the GitHub
              experience since the early days and is an integral part of how we
              work together as Hubbers internally, the
              <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-06-23-whats-new-with-github-issues/">addition of powerful project planning</a>
              has given us more opportunities to test out some of our most
              exciting products.
            </p><p>
              In this post, Iâ€™m going to share how weâ€™ve been utilizing the new
              projects experience across our team (from an engineer like myself
              all the way to our VPs and team leads). We love working so closely
              with developers to ship requested features and updates (<a href="https://github.blog/changelog/label/issues/">all of which roll up into the Changelogs you see</a>), and using the new projects helps us stay consistent in our
              shipping cadence.
            </p><h2>How we think about shipping</h2><p>
              Our core team consists of members of the product, engineering,
              design, and user research teams. We recognize that good ideas can
              come from anywhere. Our process is designed to inspire, surface,
              and implement those ideas, whether they come from users,
              individual contributors, managers, directors, or VPs. To get the
              proper alignment for this group, weâ€™ve agreed on a few guiding
              principles that drive what our roadmap will look like:
            </p><p>
              ðŸ’­ <strong>The pitch</strong>: When it comes to what weâ€™re going
              to work on (outside of the big pieces of work on
              <a href="https://github.com/orgs/github/projects/4247/views/7">our roadmap</a>) people within our team can pitch ideas in our teamâ€™s repository
              for upcoming cycles (which we define as 6-8 weeks of work,
              inclusive of planning, engineering work, and an unstructured
              passion project week); these can be features, fixes, or even
              maintenance work. Every pitch must clearly state the problem itâ€™s
              solving and why itâ€™s important for us to prioritize. Some features
              that have come from this process include
              <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-the-new-github-issues-public-beta/">live updates</a>,
              <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2021-10-27-the-new-github-issues-public-beta/">burn up charts for insights</a>, and more. Note: these are all the changes you see as a
              developer, but we also have a lot of pitches come in from my
              fellow engineers focused around the developer experience. For
              example, a couple successful pitches have included reducing our CI
              time to 10 minutes, and streamlining our release process by
              switching to a ring deployment model and adding ChatOps.
            </p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pitch-image-1.png" loading="lazy"/><p>
              ðŸ’¡ In addition to using issues to propose and converse on pitches
              from the team, we use the new projects experience to track and
              manage all the pitches from the team so we can see them in an
              all-up table or board view.
            </p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/pt-pitches-image-2.png" loading="lazy"/><p>
              âœ‚ <strong>Keep it small</strong>: We knew for ourselves, and for
              developers, that we didnâ€™t want to lock them into a specific
              planning methodology and over-complicate a teamâ€™s planning and
              tracking process. For us, we wanted to plan shorter cycles for our
              team to increase our tempo and focus, so we opted for six-week
              cycles to break up and build features. Check out how we recommend
              getting started with this approach in a
              <a href="https://github.blog/2022-02-11-getting-started-with-project-planning-on-github/">recent blog post</a>.
            </p><p>
              ðŸ“¬ <strong>Ship to learn</strong>: Similar to how we ship a lot of
              our products, we knew developers and customers were going to be
              heavily intertwined with each and every ship, giving us immediate
              feedback in both the private and public beta. Their
              <a href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/issues-feedback">feedback</a>
              both influenced what we built and then how we iterated and
              continued to better the experience once something did ship. While
              there are so many people to thank, weâ€™re extremely grateful for
              all our customers along the way for being our partners in building
              GitHub Issues into the place for developers to project plan.
            </p><h2>How we used projects to do it</h2><p>
              We love that the product weâ€™re building doesnâ€™t tool a specific
              project management methodology, but equips users with powerful
              primitives that they can compose into their preferred experiences
              and workflows. This allows for many people (not just us engineers)
              involved in building and developing products at GitHub (team
              leads, marketing, design, sales, etc.) the ability to use the
              product in a way that makes sense for them.
            </p><p>
              With the above principles in mind, once a pitch has been agreed
              upon to move forward on building, that pitch issue becomes a
              tracking issue in a project table or board that we convert into
              pieces of work that fit into an upcoming cycle. A great example of
              this was when we
              <a href="https://github.com/github/roadmap/issues/289">updated the GitHub Issues icons</a>
              to lessen confusion among developers. This came in as a pitch from
              a designer on the team, and was soon accepted and moved into epic
              planning in which the team responsible began to track the
              individual pieces of work needed to make this happen.
            </p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/issuereasonsfinal.png" loading="lazy"/><h3>IC approach</h3><p>
              Letâ€™s start with how my fellow engineers, individual contributors
              and I use projects for day-to-day development within cycles. From
              our perspective on any given day, weâ€™re hyper-focused on tackling
              what issues and pull requests are assigned to us (fun fact:
              <a href="https://github.blog/changelog/2022-02-23-the-new-github-issues-february-23rd-update/">we recently added</a>
              the <code>assignee:me</code> filter to make this even easier) in a
              given cycle, so we work from more
              <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/quickstart#creating-a-user-project">individually scoped</a>
              project tables or boards that stem from the larger epic and
              iteration tracking. Because of this, we can easily zoom out from
              our individual tasks to see how our work fits into a given cycle,
              and then even zoom out more into how it fits into larger
              initiatives.
            </p><p>
              ðŸ’¡ In addition to scoping more specifically a given table or
              board, engineers across our organization utilize a personal
              project table or board to track all the things specific to
              themselves like what issues are assigned to themâ€”even work not
              connected to a given cycle, like open source work.
            </p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/glorthopersonal-image-5.png" loading="lazy"/><h3>EM approach</h3><p>
              If we pull back to engineering managers overseeing those smaller
              cycles, theyâ€™re focused on kicking off an accepted pitchâ€™s work,
              breaking it first into cycles and then into smaller iterations in
              which they can assign out work. A given cycleâ€™s table or board
              view allows the managers to have a whole look at all members of
              their team and look specifically at things that are important to
              them, like all the pull requests that are open and quickly seeing
              which engineers are assigned, what pull requests have been merged,
              deployed, etc.
            </p><p>ðŸ’¡ Check out what this looks like in our team board.</p><img src="https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/backlog-image-6.png" loading="lazy"/><h3>Team lead approach</h3><p>
              Now, if we put ourselves in the shoes of our team leads and
              Directors/VPs, we see that theyâ€™re using the new projects
              experience to primarily get the full picture of where product and
              feature development currently sit. They told me the main team
              roadmap and backlog is where they can get questions answered like:
            </p><ul><li>Which projects do we have in flight in which product area right
                now?</li><li>Whoâ€™s the key decision maker for this project?</li><li>Which engineers are working on which projects?</li><li>Which projects are at risk and need help (progress/status)?</li></ul><p>
              Whatâ€™s great about this is that they can quickly glance at whatâ€™s
              in motion and then click into any cycles or status to get more
              context on open issues, pull requests, and how everything is
              connected.
            </p><p>
              ðŸ’¡ Outside of being able to check in on whatâ€™s being worked on and
              where the organizationâ€™s current focus is, our leads have found
              additional use cases that may not be applicable for an engineer
              like me. They use private projects for more sensitive tasks, like
              managing our teamâ€™s hiring, tracking upcoming start dates, making
              sure theyâ€™re staying on top of career development, organizational
              change management, and more.
            </p><h2>Wrap-up</h2><p>
              This is how we as the planning and tracking team at GitHub are
              using the very product weâ€™re building for you to build the new
              projects experience. There are many other teams across GitHub that
              utilize the new project tables and boards, but we hope this gives
              you a little bit of inspiration about how to think about project
              planning on GitHub and how to optimize for all the stakeholders
              involved in building and shipping products.
            </p><p>
              Whatâ€™s great about project planning on GitHub is that our focus on
              powerful primitives approach to project management means that
              there is an unlimited amount of flexibility for you and your team
              to play around with, and likely many, many ways we havenâ€™t even
              thought about how to use the product. So,
              <a href="https://github.com/github/feedback/discussions/categories/issues-feedback">please let us know</a>
              how youâ€™re using it and how we can improve the experience!
