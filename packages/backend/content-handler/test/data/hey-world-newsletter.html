        <div>
          With Twitter under new ownership, it's a great time for us to imagine
          how this hellscape might actually get fixed. And by fixed, I mean be a
          place where people enjoy hanging out, where the debate over content
          moderation is settled, and where Elon Musk might make his money back.
          Easy peasy then!<br /><br />To start, here's my fundamental premise:
          The internet is full of the bland, the wonderful, the obscure, the
          sacrilegious, the offensive, the infuriating, and the nasty. The
          internet, as a whole, is governed by local laws on speech, not by a
          council of global content moderators, not by single individuals. This
          is a feature not a bug.<br /><br />An American can sue another
          American under US defamation laws for stuff posted on the internet.
          But the Thai government won't get an American extradited under its
          lèse-majesté laws if that person offends the country's monarch on the
          internet. Restrictions on speech are based on jurisdictions (and
          Twitter is thankfully liable in one of most liberal speech
          jurisdictions around). This is also a feature not a bug.<br /><br />Twitter
          should embrace these features, and accept its role as a fundamental
          protocol. Just like HTTP, just like SMTP, just like FTP. All protocols
          that can be used to transmit all sorts of disagreeable content, but
          where the moderation of said content is left to individuals, not some
          all-knowing overlords.<br /><br />This isn't possible today because
          Twitter shoves so much speech in front of you that you never asked to
          see. It allows strangers to invade popular threads with no protections
          available to the original author.<br /><br />You know that you can
          find the most vile, nasty shit on the internet if you search for the
          right words on Google. So most people just don't do that! They manage
          their own exposure by moderating their own behavior. This is again a
          feature, not a bug.<br /><br />This could be Twitter!<br /><br />If
          Twitter stopped shoving all this speech you never asked to see in
          front of you, there would be no need for an army of content
          moderators. The internet at large is not filtered through such an
          army, and it's all the better for it. Governments keep trying to
          impose such a filter, but so far only the most authoritarian regimes
          have succeeded (and up until a few minutes ago, there was broad
          consensus in the Western world that this was bad).<br /><br />This
          would mean that Twitter would have to change in a few fundamental
          ways:<br /><br />
        </div>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Only speech from people you've asked to follow should appear in your
            feed. If any of those people post something disagreeable to your
            tastes, you can moderate that content by unfollowing them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Authors should be deputized as content moderators of their own
            posts. Just like someone hosting a blog with comments on the
            internet is. You can either say you don't want comments at all, that
            comments need to be pre-approved, that you'll remove the bad ones,
            or that you'll just let it flow.
          </li>
          <li>
            All the promoted tweets that Twitter wants to showcase to the world
            should pass through a positive rather than negative editorial
            process. Meaning Twitter employees pick what they like to feature
            rather than ban what they don't.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <div>
          <br />Thus, like the internet at large, everyone gets to control the
          kind of speech they're exposed to. Different people will come to
          different conclusions on the kind speech they wish to be exposed to.
          This is the fundamental wisdom of the infamous Section 230 protection
          that has allowed the internet as we know it to exist.<br /><br />This
          curation should be something you can outsource to trusted delegates.
          Let me experience Twitter as a list of authors and threads maintained
          by someone I trust.<br /><br />It'll also mean, like the internet at
          large, that you'll be able to find Bad Words, Terrible Words, No Good
          Words, if you deliberately seek them out. Twitter will serve as a
          portal to this in the same way Google does. These words may be hurtful
          or harmful.<br /><br />But all the content moderators in the world
          couldn't put the utopia that a platform for hundreds of millions won't
          contain disagreeable speech together again. <br /><br />Accept that
          reality. Accept that the price we pay for an open, free internet is
          one which permits the darker sides of humanity. Lean on the local
          jurisdictions and laws, democratically controlled as they are, to
          police this reality. Like we've done with that beautiful bastard that
          is the internet.<br /><br />Let Twitter be free to ascend to sit
          amongst all the other fundamental protocols that constitutes the
          pantheon of the internet.<br /><br />You can do it, Mr Musk!
