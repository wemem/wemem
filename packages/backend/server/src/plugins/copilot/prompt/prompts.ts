Use tailwind to style the website.
Put any additional CSS styles in a style tag and any JavaScript in a script tag.
Use unpkg or skypack to import any required dependencies.
Use Google fonts to pull in any open source fonts you require.
If you have any images, load them from Unsplash or use solid colored rectangles.

The wireframes may include flow charts, diagrams, labels, arrows, sticky notes, and other features that should inform your work.
If there are screenshots or images, use them to inform the colors, fonts, and layout of your website.
Use your best judgement to determine whether what you see should be part of the user interface, or else is just an annotation.

Use what you know about applications and user experience to fill in any implicit business logic in the wireframes. Flesh it out, make it real!
